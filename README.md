<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Simple Storage Smart Contract is a basic Ethereum smart contract that demonstrates the core functionalities of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides the following features:

- **Storage of Favorite Number:** Users can store their favorite numbers on the Ethereum blockchain using the smart contract.

- **Retrieve Favorite Number:** Users can retrieve their stored favorite numbers from the smart contract.

- **List and Map Data Structure:** The smart contract utilizes list and map data structures to manage and organize stored data efficiently.

### Built With

The project is built using the following technologies:

* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.

* [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/): The programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): Used for scripting and interacting with the smart contract.

* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): A BDD/TDD assertion library for testing JavaScript code.
